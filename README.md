# ACM-BMES-Mobile-Application
Making a mobile sample-analyzing application for BMES

The Biomedical Engineering Society at UC Merced contracted ACM to build a Mobile Application that can analyze the concentration of uric acid in a sample and discern whether the concentration is dangerous. The app will conduct an experiment analyzing color changes on a paper assay affected by uric acid, based on a procedure developed by a scientific paper *Sensitive colorimetric assay for uric acid and glucose detection based on multilayer-modified paper with smartphone as signal readout* by Wang et al. This app will take pictures of the experiment location and use image processing with OpenCV to determine the concentration of uric acid and output a risk status.
