# ACM-BMES-Mobile-Application
Making a mobile experiment-analyzing application for BMES

BMES blurb: The Biomedical Engineering Society at UC Merced contracted ACM to build a Mobile Application that will conduct an experiment analyzing color changes on a paper assay affected by uric acid, based on a scientific paper. This app will take pictures of the experiment location and use image processing to decide whether the concentration of uric acid is dangerous.
